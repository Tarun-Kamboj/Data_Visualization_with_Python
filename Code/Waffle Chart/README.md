## Introduction

A waffle chart is an interesting visualization that is normally created to display progress toward goals. It is commonly an effective option when you are trying to add interesting visualization features to a visual that consists mainly of cells, such as an Excel dashboard.

Unfortunately, unlike R, waffle charts are not built into any of the Python visualization libraries. Therefore, we will learn how to create them from scratch in the [Notebook here](Notebook.ipynb).
