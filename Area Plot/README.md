`Area Graphs` or `Area Plots` are [`Line Plots`](https://github.com/Tarun-Kamboj/Data_Visualization_with_Python/blob/master/Line%20Plot) but with the area below the line filled in with a certain colour or texture.

The [Notebook here](Notebook.ipynb) contains the code of area plots like the one shown below.
